		<b>Quote </b><br>
		 At the beginning of a new school year, five students—Simon, Addy, Cooper, Bronwyn, and Nate—are given detention. After drinking a cup of water, Simon suffers a sudden and fatal allergic reaction. Nate notices that Bronwyn has stolen Simon's laptop. The following morning, the four students are introduced to Officer Miller, who has initiated an investigation on Simon's death, which was a result of a peanut allergy that spawned when traces of peanut oil were inserted into the cup he was drinking from.
